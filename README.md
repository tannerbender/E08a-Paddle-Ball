# E08a-Paddle-Ball
This is the first Godot exercise for BL-MSCH-C220.

Within this file we are beginning a paddle board game within Godot. Godot is a game editor. Within Godot we have created a few 2D assets and sprites that represent that of a paddle board game. If you run the scene you will see the beginning of what appears to be a game. xs
